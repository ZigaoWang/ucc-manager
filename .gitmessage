feat(ui): improve card density and badge display

- Add responsive card density settings (3/4/5 columns)
- Fix badge overflow in compact view
- Abbreviate 'Time Limit Exceeded' to 'TLE'
- Add persistent density preferences
- Adjust spacing and padding for each density level

The changes improve the UI by:
1. Making badges more compact in dense view
2. Using smaller font size for badges in compact mode
3. Reducing padding and spacing between elements
4. Ensuring consistent display across all view modes

Resolves: Badge overflow issue in compact view
